1. What bugs and conceptual difficulties did you encounter?
    How did you overcome them? What did you learn?

    * The most difficult part of the project for me was getting the Q table to update
    with the correct values. The main problems were getting the min and max values.
    I learned that there were problems using Double.MINVALUE or MAXVALUE when comparing
    numbers.

2. I worked with Cameron and Nalvi for some parts of the project. We were going over
some of the concepts together.

3. Again the min and max values took a long time to get through to get the Q table to update
correctly.

4. N/a

5. This project was an interesting one. I definitely underestimated the amount of time
that it would take to complete. I also felt that a minimax algorithm would work better for this
game, but I am not sure.
